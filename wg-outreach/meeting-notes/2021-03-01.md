## Agenda

### Discord Community Server
* Hashimoto stepping down: Electron bot migration
* For the future: we should think of moderation solutions for non-North American time zones.
* Partner program: we still haven’t gotten an answer yet from Discord.

### OpenJS Foundation AMA
* Context: The foundation hosts monthly AMAs with foundation projects
* They’re interested in doing one with Electron! It could be for Electron or specific initiative in project (e.g. a major release)
* Format:
  * Casual chat between moderator and project members
  * Live YouTube stream with VOD saved for reference
  * A list of questions is gathered ahead of time
  * For participating project members, there shouldn’t be much time commitment outside of the session itself given that the questions will be about what you already know. Note that it’s possible that we won’t have that many questions in advance.
 
### OpenJSWorld
* Two breakout sessions available for Electron

### Electron v12.0.0 stable announcement
* Blog: https://github.com/electron/electronjs.org/pull/5168
  * Erick will handle merging tomorrow morning (when the release drops)
  * Send post to Rachel when it drops so she can repost to other publications
* Tweet (Keeley can drop draft in channel)
